The EvolutionaryAlgorithmSensorOptimizationController.py file is the main file I have used in my research studying the applications of evolutionary algorithms into swarm robotics. 
All other files are starter files or files to help build up the evolutionary algorithms:
EvolutionaryAlgorithmController.py - Implimentation of the evolutionary algorithm with an easier task.
AlgorithmOne.py, AlgorithmTwo.py, AlgorithmThree.py - Smaller sections of the evolutionary algorithm and part of the algorithm to find area sensor coverage in Webots
HexagonConfiguration files - Contains the files for each individual robot and the centralized node; Arranges all 6 individual robots into a hexagonal configuration
SensorCoverage files - Contains the files for the individual robots and the centralized node; Finds the sensor coverage and attempts to optimize the coverage
CircularTask files - Containes the files for the individual robots and the centralized node; Uses a small circle as a baseline for sensor area coverage.
CombinedTask.py - First attempt at incorporating the evolutionary algorithm alongside censor coverage with translational movement
Webots files - A world used to get familiar with Webots and gain experience with the robots, controllers, and other components
