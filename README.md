**The EvolutionaryAlgorithmSensorOptimizationController.py** - This is the main file I  used in my research on the applications of evolutionary algorithms in swarm robotics. 
All other files are starter files or files to help build up the evolutionary algorithms. 
**EvolutionaryAlgorithmController.py** - This file contains the implementation of the evolutionary algorithm with a simpler task. 
**AlgorithmOne.py, AlgorithmTwo.py, AlgorithmThree.py** - These are smaller sections of the evolutionary algorithm and are part of the system that determines area sensor coverage in Webots. 
**HexagonConfiguration files** - These files contain the setup for each individual robot and the centralized node. They arrange all 6 individual robots into a hexagonal configuration. 
**SensorCoverage files** -  These files include data for the individual robots and the centralized node, helping to calculate sensor coverage and optimize it. 
**CircularTask files** - These files contain data for the individual robots and the centralized node, using a small circular area as a baseline for sensor coverage.
**CombinedTask.py** - This file represents the first attempt to incorporate the evolutionary algorithm with sensor coverage optimization through translational movement.
**Webots files** - **A world used to get familiar with Webots and gain experience with the robots, controllers, and other components**
